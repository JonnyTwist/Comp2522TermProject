When first starting my personal game I was curious how far AI could get me to a complete game of tablut
which I could then use as a starting point to add my own twist to the game. Although I spent over an hour
trying this I eventually gave up and started making my own game from scratch. I was able to salvage some
ideas from its attempt such as creating Piece and Position objects.
