Deepseek:
When first starting my personal game I was curious how far AI could get me to a complete game of tablut
which I could then use as a starting point to add my own twist to the game. Although I spent over an hour
trying this I eventually gave up and started making my own game from scratch. I was able to salvage some
ideas from its attempt such as creating Piece and Position objects.

Switched to ChatGPT:







By the end of the term project I used chatGPT frequently to help me make my comments better. My experience getting
comments from AI was far smoother than my experience getting code. It was still a little finicky having some comments
run for many, many lines while some were only one line. It also used unusual notations which I thought made the comments
a little harder to read, so I was frequently removing those.
